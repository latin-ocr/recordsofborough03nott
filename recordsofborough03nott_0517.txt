the large beads in a rosary or

is derived from gaudete (rejoice ye)
in allusion to Luke, i. 143 but the
connection is not very obvious. As
there are five of these gauds on an
ordinary rosary, it is probable that
they derive their name from the
Quinque Gaudia or Five Joys os
the Virgin. There is a ME. poem
on this subject in Wright’s Reliquiae
Antsquae, i. 48, and in Miitzner's
Spraclzproben, i. 51.]
