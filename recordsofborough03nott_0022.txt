kept by Easingwold, a few minutes of the proceedings os the Common
Council os the Borough. The proceedings in suits in which the
Sherifss were directly or indirectly interested are also entered in
the Hall Books. The Borough Court seems at this period to have
been regarded as the Sheriffs' Court: hence actions to which they
were parties were heard before the Mayor and the proceedings were
entered in the Mayoralty (or Hall) Book instead os in the Court
Books. It is true that there are one or two cases in which the
Sheriffs do not appear as plaintiffs or desendants, but it is probable
that they were interested in these cases in some manner. The
following is a list os the Hall Books of this date now in existence:
No. 3351, Ap. 1500-1; No. 3352, M). 1502-3; No. 3353, Μ). ι5ο3-4ς
No. 3354, AJ). 1510-11; No. 3355, Aa). 1517-18; No. 3356, AD. 1523-
24; No. 3356 b, Ap. 1533-4; No. 3356 c, AD. 1538-9.

9. The papers os XVILLIAM GREGORY have preserved for us a
copy of Dame Agnes Mellers' Ordinances sor the Free School
founded by her. It is printed within at page 453. It is to be re-
gretted that Gregory did not give the date of this interesting docu-
ment. From Gregory are also derived the notice of the allowance os
the immunity of the Mayor and Burgesses from the Forest Laws
printed at page 452; the licences to enclose land in the open fields
of the town for the benefit of the Free School printed at page 457;
and the order os the Council printed at page 458 regulating the sale
os sheepskins. W'e are also indebted to VVILLIAM GREAVES sor
copies os several valuable papers of this period, the originals of
which have disappeared since his time. The oaths os office of the
Sheriffs¹ Councillors, and Chamberlains printed at page 447, and the
interesting list of Tolls taken by the Burgesses of Retford (by virtue
os the ancient lease from the Burgesses of Nottingham) printed at
page 450, are derived from Greaves. Gregory and Greaves give
abstracts or copies of several deeds, etc„ that are still in existence.
In these cases the originals have been used, and the notes of Gregory
and Greaves have been consequently passed over in silence.

gives us a graphic account of the fearful destruction of MSS.
