³ This is derived srom notes in a hand-
writing much resembling that os Robert
Seagrave, Town Clerk, 1758-1790. It
would seem srom the heading to these
extracts that the Rcd Book was not wholly
destroyed. These notes are entered on
blank pages of Greaves’ papers. They
have been already printed, but very in-

correctly, in Bailey's Annals os hotting-
lmmslzire, i. p. 378. The text there given
was evidently derived from these notes,
although it purports to be taken srom
‘an ancient book of the Corporation,
greatly damaged by fire.' The orthography
of the original MS. has not been very
rigorously adhered to. The MS. was, like
the preceding extract, probably in the
hantlwriting os Williarn Easingwold.
⁴ sho'd=should.
