Plea by Wm't of Rzglct.¹——Alexander‚ son of Henry de Notting-
ham, of Thrussington, demands against Lawrence le Bere, of Not-
tingham, and Isabella his wife, a messuage, with appurtenances,
excepting twenty feet os land in length and ten feet of land in

sbreadth‚ in Nottingham, as his right and inheritance.

And where-

his demesne as of see and right,2 except the twenty feet of land in
length and ten feet of land in breadth, in time of peace‚² in the time of
King Edward the father of the present King Edward, by taking the

Book, 1 Edw. ΙΙΙ., states that there were
in Nottingham two tenures, one called
[huglz-Engloyes and the other Burglt-
Frmmcoycs, and thar the descent in the
English Borough was to the youngest son,
whilst in the Freneh Borough the descent

was as at common law. See Ehon,
Orzjgins os English llz'story, p. 184. This
seems to have been regarded as the earliest
case in the Year Books, and hence the
name Borouglt-English was adopted as a
convenient designation sor this custom-
But there is a case reported in the nar
Book, 21-22 Edw.1.‚ pp. 211, 213, and
llracton distinctly refers to the custonl3

lib. ii.‚ c. 34, 3* 1 (vol. i.‚ p. 602).
