INTRODUCTION. xvii

that occurred when the monastic libraries were dispersed. He tells
us that ‘a greate nombre of them whych purchased those super-
stycyouse mansions [the monasteries] reserved of those lybrarye
bokes, some . . . to scoure theyr candelstyckes‚ and some to rubbe
their bootes. Some they solde to the grossers and sope sellers, and
some they sent ouer see to the bokebynders‚ not in small nombre, but
at tymes whole shyppes full, to the wonderynge of foren nacyons. . . .
I knowe a merchaunt man, whych shall at thys tyme be namelesse,
that boughte the contentes of two noble lybraryes for XL. shyllynges
pryce, a shame it is to be spoken. Thys stuffe hath he occupyed in
the stede of graye paper by the space of more than these X. yeares,
and yet he hath store ynough sor as many yeares to come.'1 The
latter portion of his remarks meets with singular confirmation
amongst the Nottingham Corporation records. About the time of
the dissolution of the monasteries and far into Queen Elizabeth’s
reign we meet with many fragments of early MSS. used as covers to
various books. This is analogous to the use of these MSS. for
‘graye' or, as we should now say, brown paper, for these parchment
covers consist os two leaves of a book enclosing a few quires os
paper. Several of these fragments are from service books and are
therefore of no great value. No. 1399, the Court Book for ΑΒ. 1527—8,
has covers formed out of three leaves of a copy of the Digest of
Justinian. These are derived from what must have been a mag-
nificent folio copy of this great legal work. The text is written in a
beautiful 13th century hand, rubricated ln red and blue‚ whilst the
margins of the pages are covered with the voluminous glosses of
ACCURSIUS of Florence (circa 1182 to circa 1260). These glosses
are written in a much darker ink than the text and the handwriting
is smaller and more compressed. There are also some glosses in a
little later and more cursive hand. These three leaves comprise parts
” of the titles De Duobus Reis szslz'lltcndzssr (XLV, tit. ii.)‚ DL· Fide-
