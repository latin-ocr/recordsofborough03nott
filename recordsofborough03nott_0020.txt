xiv INTRODUCTION.

with. Three os these are in Easingwold's handwriting. In these the
payments are caresully arranged under suitable headings, and the
books are kept in the clean and neat style characteristic of this
Clerk. A fite-simile of one of his pages accompanies this volume.
It would seem that these neat and tidy accounts were copied from
the rough accounts of the Chamberlains or their clerks, sor one
account (No. XII„ page 270) was evidently examined and annotated
by Easingwold with a view to codification⁴ Two os the later
accounts (No. LXVI„ page 360, and No. LXXVIII„ page 375) are
the original accounts of the Chamberlains as distinguished from the
clean copies that should have been made by the Mayor’s Clerk. The
latter os these two is noticeable for its erratic orthography, remark-
able even in an age of somewhat unsettled spelling. It has been
found necessary to omit much of the contents of this account, but
sufficient has been printed to justify these remarks. Some of the
more peculiar orthographies in the omitted portions are cambores,
campores (chambers), carlceares, carlcelmres (carriers), casse (causeway),
crayl (gravel), llajgrolreyg (Hazlerig), lmygc (hedge), lavorerfflabourer),
layng (‘ ling'), loyg· (load), lomnes (thorns). A sac-simile os page 8 os
this account forms one of the plates in the present volume. The
erratic orthography of documents of this period written by laymen
contrasts strongly with the comparatively regular orthography os
the clerks An examination of the English presentments at the
Sessions and the bills sor goods, etc., in this volume will substantiate
the above statement.
