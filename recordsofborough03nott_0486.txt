This List has been compiled upon the same principles as the similar lists in the pre-
ceding volumes. Names derived srom Greaves' List are marked with an asterisk (Ἴ. The
names of the Aldermen are here inserted under the year in which they are sxrst described
as Aldermen. In the majority of cases there is no record os their election. They held the
office during their lifetime, unless removed sor misconduct. For this reason a few notes of
their deaths are here added. A caresul search amongst the wills at York would un-
doubtedly yield many more of these dates„ The Mayor was elected srom the Aldermen:
hence it seems certain that a man was an Alderman before he was elected Mayor, although
in many cases no record os his being Alderman exists. The Aldermen were Justices os the
Peace by virtue os their office. The numbers of Burgesses enrolled are derived srom Greaves.
