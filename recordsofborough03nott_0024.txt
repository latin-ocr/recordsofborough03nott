xviii INTRODUCTION.

within page 375), which is so remarkable sor its erratic spelling, is
covered with two leaves of a Latin translation os Aristotle’s Meta-
plcysics. They are written in a monastic hand os the early part of the
thirteenth century. In the margin are written, in a fine and beautiful
hand of the early part of the fourteenth century, various glosses and
notes. These leaves comprise part os book IX„ ce. 4, 5, 6, 9, 10.
These fragments fully confirm ROGER BACON'S condemnation of the
medieval Latin versions of the great Stagyrite’s works. Bacon
went so far as to advise the burning of all the Latin versions of
Aristotle then current, on the ground that it was a loss of time to
study them.1 He also asserts that no mortal can truly understand
anything from these translations, as his own cxper1ence showcd.2
This is certainly true of the Nottingharn fragments, sor the hypo-
thetical cases are stated in the indicative mood, there Is a most
bewildering carelessness in the rendering of the particles and de·
finitions, and there are blunders that plainly prove that the transcribet·
did not understand the work he was copying. Thus substantia
means both ‘the subject of the discourse'3 and ‘the being, essence or
nature of a thing;’4 per accidens (accidently) translates ‘hypotheti-
cally;’ the question whether it was Kleon or Sokrates that came,5 is
actually rendered: ‘Et quaestio est, utrum ille veniens cst melion aul
forles’! Again, ‘equality seems to be a medium between the great
and the small'6 appears as ‘erit aequale ut utrum inter magnum ct
parvum) And the hopeless jumble ‘et si non fuerit ita, cm' igilur op-
ponuntur dno* ct erunt nullm unum uni met pauco: m'lu'l minus enim est
de nulllel‘o' is intended for a translation of the original ‘for in relation
to what are two things (called) many, unless it be in relation to unity

and fewness: for nothing else is less.'⁷ These blunders, which do not
