INTRODUCTION. xiii

to stop the apparently common practice of heaping up refuse in
the streets of the town. In the selections from these rolls an en-
deavour has been made to fairly represent their diverse contents,
the only class of presentments inadequately represented being those
for scolding and immorality.

5. We have again to deploro the loss of the early Mickletorn
Jury Rolls, for there is only one preserved of the period embraced by
this volume. It is printed at page 338. The Mickletorn or Leet
Jury covered much of the same ground as the Sessions Jury, or,
rather, the latter has encroached very considerably upon the province
os the former. There is a petition from the Mickletorn Jury printed
at page 358, which proves that this jury had not entirely forgotten
its ancient powers, for they still claim to gIve their approval in the
name of the ‘Burgesses and Commonalty of the ‘town'

6. A considerable amount of interesting matter has been derived
from the Chamberlains' accounts. These accounts originally con-
sisted of a summary of the receipts and expenditure in Latin, and a
book in English giving the partiCulars of the expenditure. These
two parts have, however, become separated, and hence it is seldom
that the summary and book of the same year are both preserved.
Extracts from three early summaries, which should have appeared in
vol. ii.‚ are printed at page 412 sqq„ and the substance of one of
AD. 1499-1500 is printed at page 62. This is written in Easingwold's
hand upon paper and is evidently a rough draft. The earlier ones
are written upon parchment. After Easingwold's tirne the summaries
are much briefer; indeed, they consist of little more than a state-
ment of the totals os the chief heads of receipts and expenditure.
As they contain very little matter of interest, they are not repre-
sented in this volume. Most of thern have-certificates signed by
the Mayor, Aldermen, etc., os their having been audited. There are
twelve of these summaries preserved of the period embraced by the
present volume. The particulars of the expenditure are written in
small folio books of paper. Several of these books are here printed
in full, and the others are represented by ample extracts. There are
eight of these books preserved of the period we are now dealing
