BONER, 273, 26, 29. This word
means properly tenants who were
bound to do ‘boon-work' sor their
lords, an incident of agricultural
tenure that is not yet altogether
obsolete. ‘ Boon' is from the O.N.
‘b6n,' a prayer, being historically
the same word as the AS. ‘be'n,’ a
prayer, as in ‘ben-r1'p,’ the service
of reaping gratuitously‚ and ‘ben-
yr&,⁷ the service of ploughing
gratuitously. Both the AS. and
O.N. words represent a primitive
Teutonic ‘rheni-23 the i having
modified the ὁ to ἑ in AS. accord-
ing to rule. The younger (modi-
fied) form also occurs in O.N. as
‘bi'mj the ἰ here modisying the ὁ to
ᾧ. Hence Swed. ‘bon‚⁷ Dan.
‘bons But although the boon-
works (opera) of the Burgesses of
Nottingham are mentioned in the
Domesday Survey, there is no
evidence of the Burgesses perform-
ing these villein services after they
got the ruling of the town into
their own hands. Hence it is more
probable that the ‘boners’ of
page 273 were Burgesses who
had volunteered to do the work
gratuitously. ‘Booning' is used
with this meaning in N01·thants;
see Baker's Glossaay, i. 65.
