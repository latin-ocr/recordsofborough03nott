. lately feared that he was infectcd with the infirmity of the pestilencc,¹
5 the aforesaid Mark carne to the aforesaid Richard Dawson and under-
took to cure him of the infirmity aforesaid; nevertheless the aforesaid
Mark did not cure the aforesaid Richard of the infirmity aforesaid,

From the men of the town of Nottingham for the ferm of their

town, 2654 12s.4

From the same men for the increment of their town, 258ss
From the same men for two ferms, to wit, for the duty of houses

ficiency was found in practice to average
about 5 per centum, and hence, sor the
sake of convenience, serms blank were
converted into ferms de numero by adding
52„ See Madox, Historyoftlzc Exchcqucr,
i. 274. So that „4⁶52 blank, the see-serm of
Nottingham, plus 52 equals 2554 125. de
numero, the amount above stated.

⁵ This is the increment of the see-ferm
fixed hythe Charter of Edward 1. (vol. ἰ,
of this work, p. 58).

⁶ This should read ‘de censu plurim-
arum domorum et de tofto monetariorum '
(=for the tas οἱ several houses and for the
moneyers’ rost). There is printed in Deer-

20 and for the toft of the Manor,6 323. 6d.

King's possessions in Nottingham, made
by Sir Henry Croke, Clerk of the Pipe,
on April 27, 1650, for the trustees for the
sale of see-serm rents, etc. It is there
stated that 235. 6d. were first charged in
the l’ipe Roll of 6 Richard Ι. (11945),
and that an annual increment of 9s. was
added in the Pipe Roll for 7 John (1205-6).
The charge appears, without the incre-
ment, in the Rolulus Cam-ellarii, 3 John,
p. 308. This is the Chancellor·s counter·
part of the l’ipe Roll, so that Crokc's
statement of the date of the fixing os the
increment is no doubt correct. In 1204,
king John confirmed to the monks os
Durham the land os Onicarus (= QN.
