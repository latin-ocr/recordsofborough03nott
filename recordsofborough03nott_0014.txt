of this supplement to insert the record of a suit in 1336 regarding
the custom of Borough English. One of these deeds (No. ΙΙ., p. 408)
shows that the Mayor and Burgesses raised, by means of a lease, Α 20
in order to surnish soldiers to accompany Henry VI. when he
marched against the rebels under Cade. The summaries of the
Chamberlains' accounts prove that the reference by Queen Elizabeth
lVoodville to the burdens and losses sustained by the town on behalf
of her husband¹ was no empty rhetorical flourish. In 1461-2 the
town defrayed the expenses of soldiers to assist Edward, and in the
early part of the year 1471 he received considerable loans from the
town at a very critical juncture in his fortunes. Nottingham con-
tinued faithful to his brother Richard 111.‚ but, immediately after his
defeat at Bosworth Field, a deputation was despatched in hot haste
to his victorious opponent to obtain his safeguard and proclamation.
The bill of the expenses of this deputation is preserved and is
printed in full at page 245. We have, at page 383 sqq.¹ an account
of the cost of equipping soldiers for the memorable expedition to
Boulogne.2 Of more purely local interest is the Subsidy Roll
printed at page 162, which is to all intents and purposes a direc-
tory of the inhabitants of the town. In this volume we obtain
clearer views of the interna] condition of the town, its sanitary
arrangementS‚ its squabbles about government, etc. There are dis-
tinct traces of the stages of the development of the ruling Com-
mittee, actIng in conjunction with the body of the Burgesses, into
the close Corporation, which eventually excluded the Burgesses from
all but the most nominal control or power over its constitution. We
can see how jealously the commonalty regarded the ceaseless en-
croachments of the Council and how resolutely they resisted their
gradual exclusion from the ruling of the town. The presentments at
the Sessions are the chief witnesses to this independent spirit of the
Burgesses. These presentments are of further interest, inasmuch as
they show how completely the Sessions’ Jury had annexed duties
that originally belonged to the Leet Jury.
