INTRODUCTION. xix

exhaust the shortcomings of even four pages, are quite sufficient to
warrant Bacon's strictures upon the Latin versions of his day·
No. 1609 is further noteworthy‚ for it yields the first proof of an
acquaintance with the Classics on the partos the clerks. VVILLIAM
HOLINSHEQ the Mayor's Clerk from about AD. 1534 to about
.x.D. 1545, has written upon the covers the following line frorn Horace
(Ep. i.‚ iv. 13):

Omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum.

In another place he has written the well-known line from Virgil's

11. The plates consist of a fite-simile of a page of the
Chamberlains’ Accounts for A.D. 1485-6. This is in the neat hand-
writing of WILLIAM EASINGWOLD (see above, page ix), and is
printed in full at page 263. The other plate is also afar-simile from
the Chamberlains' Accounts, in this case sor the year 1537-8. This
page, which contrasts so unfavourably with Easingwold's page, is
partly printed at page 375. It is interesting inasrnuch as it contains
a notice of the execution at Nottingharn of some monks of Lenton
Priory. Hitherto the hanging of these monks has rested on no
better evidence than that of tradition. It now appears that they
were tried at Nottingha1n,and that they were hanged on the town
gallows on Gallows Hill (now part of the Church Cemetery, Mansfield
Road), for in the same account there is a charge for cleansing Cow
Lane (Clurnber street, on the way to the Gallows) when these
monks suffered death. W. H. S.
