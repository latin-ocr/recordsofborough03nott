GLOSSARY OF ENGLISH AND LATIN. 493

LATAMUS, 20, 19. A stone-cutter,
mason. [Gk. λατάμος, represented
in the Vulgare by lautumus, lat-
mnus]

LAWNE, 40, 17. Lawn, an early
instance of its use.

LEAD‚ 186, 13. A leaden vat, a

two great leads fixed in furnaces;
Foedera, viii. 384. But, by con-
fusion, the word ‘furnace' was
often applied to the leaden vessel,
as above, 30, 7. A.D. 1512, John
Mapurley‚ gent., sues Thomas
Langforth‚ gent, for carrying away

cauldron of lead used in brewing
for boiling the malt. Cf. our ex-
pression ‘a copper.⁷ That these
vessels were really made of lead

there is ample evidence. The =
Laws of AEiSel-stzin, iv. 7 (Schmid, ’

Anhang, xvi. ξ 1), provide ‘si l'aet

a'lfaet 1'sen offiffie ceren, liadm 013186 ’

1ειὲ111611’ = let the 2¹85ch be made
(ff imm ον hrass, lead ar earlll. In
medicval Latin the word plumbum
(lead) is used to signify a lenden
vessel, although there is a classical
plumbeum with this meaning. The
Finchale Priory account rolls,
p. ccclxxviii, contain a payment to
a plumber for a steplcde (a lead sor
steeping) and sor a b7wct-lede3 and,
at p. ccclxxxviii„ there is another
payment to the same plumber for
putting in a new bottom to a brew-
leyde‚ using 16 stone of lead and
12 lbs. of solder. Thus the word
is derived from the material of the
vessel, and has no connection
whatever with the Gaelic ‘luchd‚'
a kettle, as suggested in the Glos-
sary to Tusser's Husbczndffls, E. D.S.
The ‘lead' was frequently fixed,
like a modern domestic copper,
over a grate. The grate ancl flue
were known as a ‘furnace’ (fornax).
Hence the frequent expression ‘a
lead in furnace.' The ‘fornesse
lede' of 285, 3, is the lenden
cauldron so fixed, or intended to
be fixed‚ in a furnace. A.D. 1404-5,

a surnace (surnax) of lead con-
taining 40 lbs. of lead, value
26s.4d.; 1385, p. 67. A.D. 1516,
Hugh Cariour sues Thomas Wil-
liamson, Sergeant‚ for 145. for a
lead (mlum plmllbum) called ‘a
furnace3’ 1387, p. 15. Sometimes
these leads were fixed in wooden
stands, ag, A.D. 1530, ¹ syve leades
sette in tre [=wood‚ AS. ‘treo'] to
walle [=boil‚ AS. ‘weallan '] worte
in;’ Lanc. WiHs, i. 187. These
seem to be the ‘ leads in sorms' so
frequently met with, which were no
doubt smaller than the leads in
furnace. See 299, 6. A.D. 1482,
Richard Caunt sues Robert Tull
for carrying away a great furnace
(tle, a lead from a surnace), value
40s.‚ and a groutled (=a lead sor
the grout in brcwing), value rod,
and three leads in form (tres ledus
informa), value 12d.; 1378, p. 68.
Smaller leads were known as gront-
lcads, 7111'lle-lcads(Lanc. lrlsslls, i. 80),
wart-lcads, coolitlgffcads, stapla&
leads, and as hand-lcads. Sec
