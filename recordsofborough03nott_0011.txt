PREFACE

The appearance of the present volume os extracts from
the Nottingham Corporation archives calls for little comment,
for the reasons that have induced the Council to proceed with
this undertaking are given in the prefaces to the preceding
volumes. To repeat those reasons would be little more than
to reprint the previous prefaces.

Although the Corporation os Nottingham may fairly
claim that their records are carefully arranged and calendared,
it is yet noteworthy that. during the progress of the present
volume, the editor has discovered several papers of interest
buried amongst some ioth century briess. Some of these
papers are of great interest. Those that are of earlier date
than the present volume are embodied in a supplement,
whilst those that relate to the period of this volume are
printed in their proper places.

The translations from the Latin have had, like those in
the previous volumes, the advantage of the revision of the
Rev. Canon Rmmz, MA, Dee, of York Minster: and
Mr. W. H. STEVENSON is responsible sor the selectim, tran-
scription‚ and editing. Mr. STl—A‘ENsON has also supplied the

notes, Glossaries, etc.
