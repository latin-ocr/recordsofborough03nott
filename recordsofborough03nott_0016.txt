and to face the careless, sprawling hands in which most of the other
MSS. are written—hands that add very considerably to the dis-
comfort of perusing ream after ream of formal and uninteresting
matter. These remarks hold especially good of the Court Books,
which are only very rarely relieved by additions in Easingwold's
hand. Easingwold has a further claim upon our gratitude, for he
displayed a marked preference for English, although he wrote in
Latin with considerable ease. He wrote in English not only accounts
and minutes but even more formal documents‚ such as 103505,ΓοοΗ-
ments, etc. We can also claim for him that he had something like
a uniforrn orthography for English. Many of the papers in his
writing are pointed out in this volume. A fairly reliable guide to
the English documents written by him is found in his retention of
the sign l), which his successors wholly relinquishcd for y or tlt.

3. The Court Books are very well preserved and are very bulky,
but they clo not contain a large proportion of interesting matter.
Owing to the carelessness of the clerks in entering declarations in
them, there are preserved some hundreds of bills relating to suits.
These bills were inserted between the leaves of the Court Books
instead of being embodied in the declarations of the actions to
which they relate. They are mostly in the handwriting of the
plaintiffs, and they present a great variety of writing and ortho-
graphy. Several of them are printed in this volume. The Court
Books are so bulky that many of them are divided into two
parts, one containing the suits between Burgesses and the other
the Foreign Suits (l'lacila Forz'nsem). Several of these books are
sewn into parchment covers, These covers have frequently pro-
verbs, ete, written upon them, probably jotted down by the clerks
during the sittings of the Court. The Court Book for 1491-2

(No. 1374) has the following hexameters against book-thieves:¹
