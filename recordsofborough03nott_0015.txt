INTRODUCTION. ix

2. The documents in the English tongue form a much larges
portion of this volume than the corresponding papers in its pre-
decessor. This is a subject for congratulati0n, for, in addition to
the greater interest the papers derive from being written in the
mother tongue instead of in monotonous (and sometimes irritatingly
slipshod) Latin, we have the great advantage of saving the space
occupied by the translations. We are thus able to print double the
quantity of matter. The value these English documents possess for
philological purposes has been previously referred to. The present
volume shows the loss of many words now peculiar to the northern
dialects of England, and it suggests how the north-Midland dialects
have increased the differences between them and the northern
dialects by their gradual assimilation to the other Midland dialects
and, therefore, to the standard English. This seems to be a fitting
place to bear testImony to the great merits of XVILLIAM EASING-
WOLD‚ who filled the post of Mayor¹s (or Town) Clerk from about
1478 to about 1506. Judging merely by the number of papers
still existing written in his small and beautiful hand, we are quite
justified in stating that he must have been a most hardworking and
zealous official. During the perlod of his office the records are kept
in a style that contrasts singularly with the chaos that preceded and
succecdcd him. The earliest minutes of the proceedings of the
Council are in Easingwold's hand. His successors for many years
passed over these proceedings without a note in the Hall Books.
This is a fair sample of his zeal and care. A comparison of the
Chamberlains' accounts in this volume written by Easingwold with
those written by other clerks will afford fresh evidence of the careful
and methodic manner in which he sulfilled his duties as contrasted
with the perfunctory manner of his successors His handwriting, of
which an example is given in one of the plates in this volume, stands
out in an equally advantagcous light when compared with that os his
successors and contemporaries.¹ It is a weariness of the flesh to

turn from the Hall Books or other records written by Easinngold

¹ The only exception to this generali· successor as Mayor‘s Clerk, who wrote a
zation is William Barwell, his immediate fine, bold hand.
