iton crow-bar.' Atkinson, Philo-
logical Soc. Trans„ 1867, p. 349,
defines the Cleveland ‘coulpress‚ ¹
cowlpress’ as ‘a lever os wood, a ¹
staff capable of being employed as ¹
a lever‚' but he erroneously con· l
nects it with the ‘cowl-staff’ of
Shakespeare, for ‘cowl' is here a
corruption os cavella, a tub. If
the r be proved to be intrusive,
this word may ultimately have the
same origin as nappin-e, vit. O.Fr.

‘ Cob-irons.’
