Ι. The MSS. whence the present volume has been derived are
much greater in number and bulk than the materials for the pre-
ceding volumes. Indeed, it would hardly be an exaggeration to say
that the MSS. for the period embraced by this present volume are
equal in bulk and contents to those os the two preceding volumes.
The proportion of interesting matter in the MSS. has, however,
decreased, partly because the canons os admissibility have neces-
sarily to be made more stringent as the work progresses, since
entries that are of great interest when they first occur in the early
records are inadmissible after manisold repetitions in later MSS.
For instance, the extracts in this volume derived from the numerous
records of the Borough Court bear a very insignificant proportion to
the bulk of the MSS„ and many of these extracts are of minor
importance. Fortunately, however, the other classes of records have
yielded matter of great interest, so that on the whole the results
represented by the present volume will favourably compare with its
predecessors. During the progress of the present volume several
MSS. have been discovered in an unsuspected quarter, viz., arnongst
some briefs relating to suits in the early years of this present century.
Some os these should have had places in the preceding volumes, but,
as they were discovered too late sor that purpose, they are here

printed in the form osa supplement. Advantage has also been taken
